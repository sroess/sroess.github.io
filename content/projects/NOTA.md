The Night of the Arts is an impressive annual art show organized by a handful of high school students and art teachers to showcase the exceptional talents of our artistic and musical students. I had the opportunity to contribute to this event by creating the posters for the talent show. The posters we created became an integral part of promoting the event and capturing the essence of the talent show.

I had a lot of fun learning how to design posters and doing things in Photoshop I had never done before. I learned how to stage and finish a photoshoot in a very short period of time, especially when I had to trek across the school to photograph one group, only to turn around 20 minutes later and photograph another musician. This was a really fun project, and I've very grateful I had the opportunity to work on it.
