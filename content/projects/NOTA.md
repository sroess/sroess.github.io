The Night of the Arts is an impressive annual art show organized by a handful of high school students and art teachers to showcase the exceptional talents of our artistic and musical students. I had the opportunity to contribute to this event by creating the posters for the talent show. The posters we created became an integral part of promoting the event and capturing the essence of the talent show.
