The Seattle Aquarium is filled with many of the beautiful creatures that share our local waters. Not only were they stunning to appreciate in person, but they also made fantastic models. Below are several of my favorites (shoutout to the Spotted Lagoon Jellyfish and the Puffins, they clearly had gone to modeling school).
