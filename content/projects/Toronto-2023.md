One of my favorite things to do is use my camera as a way to unpack the personality of a space, or person. During the summer of 2023, I had the chance to visit Toronto and tour the various urban and natural environments that coexist within the city. I noticed that as soon as one stepped outside of the bustling city, an immediate tranquil and natural mood took over. This juxtaposition of energies is something I really tried to capture within this project.
