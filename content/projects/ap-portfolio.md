What is identity? Can art reveal how people develop their unique personalities & represent what the search for self looks like? My visuals dismantle some of the physical factors that have influenced my identity, such as fashion, culture & media, to find meaning in their abstract forms, and depict the search for self in a representational way. My photos serve as a reminder of the strife of identity development. This strife is caused by the perceived presence of imperfection, but, what is an imperfection? My work features contemplation of how imperfections exist within our identity.
