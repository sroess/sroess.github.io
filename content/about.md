## Hi there! My name is Sophia, and I'm a photographer in my Senior year of High School.

I first picked up a camera during the Covid pandemic, a new hobby to keep me busy during the long days. I learned new skills by immersing myself in resources such as Masterclass and CreativeLive videos to learn about lighting techniques and experimenting with different lenses. Photography has become my passion, a remarkable art form that allows me to unveil the essence of a person or place and convey it in a universally understandable way. My ability to think on my feet, coupled with a willingness to experiment, are my greatest strengths. I practice these qualities every time I'm behind the camera, especially when documenting new places or capturing the details of people and locations.

Everyone needs a good photo. Whether you are an athlete, a musician, or a graduate looking for a portfolio to showcase your skills, a professional in search of a headshot to represent themselves on LinkedIn, a seller wanting to attract customers with a good product portfolio, or simply a person looking for a fun photo portfolio, I would love to work with you!

*Examples of photo services include but are not limited to:*
* Graduate Portraits
* Sport Photography
* Portfolios for athletes, musicians, or any talents
* Pet Photography (makes a great gift!)
* Family Photos (think of Holiday cards)
* Professional Headshots
