Hi there! My name is Sophia, and I&rsquo;m a photographer in my Senior year of High School. I first picked up a camera during the Covid pandemic, a new hobby to keep me busy during the long days. I honed my skills by immersing myself in resources such as Masterclass videos to learn about lighting techniques and experimenting with different lenses. Photography has become my passion, a remarkable art form that allows me to unveil the essence of a person or place and convey it in a universally understandable way.">

<p>I first picked up a camera during the Covid pandemic, a new hobby to keep me busy during the long days. I honed my skills by immersing myself in resources such as Masterclass videos to learn about lighting techniques and experimenting with different lenses. Photography has become my passion, a remarkable art form that allows me to unveil the essence of a person or place and convey it in a universally understandable way. My ability to think on my feet, coupled with a willingness to experiment, are my greatest strengths. I employ these qualities every time I&rsquo;m behind the camera, especially when documenting new places or capturing the details of people and locations.</p>
<p>Everyone needs a good photo. Whether you are an athlete, a musician, or a graduate looking for a portfolio to showcase your skills, a professional in search of a headshot to represent themselves on LinkedIn, a seller wanting to attract customers with a good product portfolio, or simply a person looking for a fun photo portfolio, I would love to work with you!</p>
<p><em>Examples of photo services include but are not limited to:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Graduate Portraits</li>
<li>Sport Photography</li>
<li>Portfolios for athletes, musicians, or any talents</li>
<li>Pet Photography (makes a great gift!)</li>
<li>Family Photos (think of Holiday cards)</li>
<li>Professional Headshots</li>
</ul>
